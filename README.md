# Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises

This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress in the [Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/) course on Udemy. This course offers a comprehensive learning experience for mastering data structures and algorithms using Python.

## Course Overview
The course includes 35 sections, 110 lectures, and a total length of 8 hours and 2 minutes. It covers various topics in data structures and algorithms such as:

- Big O notation
- Lists, Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Binary Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Search algorithms (Breadth First Search, Depth First Search)

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the course, I aim to:

- Gain expertise in data structures and algorithms
- Understand the time and space complexity of data structures and algorithms
- Enhance my problem-solving ability
- Ace technical interviews with confidence

## Updates
As I progress through the course, I will be updating this repository with the codes and concepts learned. Each section of the course will have its own dedicated folder containing related files.
